1. Python is a dynamic, interpreted (bytecode-compiled) language. 
2. There are no type declarations of variables, parameters, functions, or methods in source code. This makes the code short and flexible, and you lose the compile-time type checking of the source code. 
3. Python tracks the types of all values at runtime and flags code that does not make sense as it runs.

#VARIABLES IN PYTHON

## Variables are the specific memory location to store the values
## Inside this variable, we can store integer, string, List, Tuple, Dictionary
## No need to declare variable with its datatype. Python will interpret it internally.

### Variable name naming convention
    # It cannot be start with a number
    # It must be start with a letter or the underscore character.
    # Only alpha-numeric characters and underscores are allowed
    # Variable names are case-sensitive

name = 'Python' # String can be declared either by single quotes or double quotes
print(name) # Python

id = 123
print(id)  # 123

# Assign multiple values to Multiple Variables in single statement

id, name, age = 1, "John", 26
print(id) # 1
print(name) # John
print(age) # 26

# assigning same value to multiple variables

p = q = r = "John"
print(p) # John
print(q) # John
print(r) # John
